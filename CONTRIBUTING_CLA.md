## Ways to contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions and not all of them need a Pull request. Contributions may include:

* New features and proposals
* Documentation
* Bug fixes
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions and giving feedback
* Helping to onboard new contributors
* Other related activities

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

* Make a fork of the repository within your GitHub account
* Create a topic branch in your fork from where you want to base your work
* Make commits of logical units
* Make sure your commit messages are with the proper format, quality and descriptiveness (see below)
* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork
* Create a pull request containing that commit

We follow the GitHub workflow and you can find more details on the [GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your pull request, we advise you to use the following:

1. Check if your code changes will pass both code linting checks and unit tests.
2. Ensure your commit messages are descriptive. We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message. See [GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues and commits.
3. Check the commits and commits messages and ensure they are free from typos.
